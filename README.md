## ✨ Overview

A simple yet elegant **To-Do List** application built with **React**, enabling users to add and remove tasks dynamically. This project is a great starting point for beginners to understand React's state management using functional components and hooks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add tasks with a button click
- 🗑️ Delete tasks by clicking on them
- 🎯 Clean and responsive UI
- ⚛️ Built with modular React components (`App`, `InputArea`, `ToDoItem`)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **React** (with Hooks)
- **JavaScript**
- **CSS**
- **Vite** (for fast development builds)

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or above)
- **npm**

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peddinenibhaswanth/ToDoList
cd ToDoList
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm start
```

Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🧪 Testing

> Currently, no test framework is integrated. However, you can manually test by interacting with the UI:
- Add a task in the input field and click **Add**
- Click on any task to remove it from the list

---

## 📌 How It Works

- `App.jsx`: Handles the state (`items`) and renders the list.
- `InputArea.jsx`: Manages input field and sends data to `App` on add.
- `ToDoItem.jsx`: Renders individual tasks and handles click-to-delete.
